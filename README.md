About: Money in the America from metal coins to paper fiat and the economic and political impacts.  A must read for anyone to understand fiat paper debt/inflation patterns throughout American history, and there are some good ones!

Takeaway: Sound hard money (gold, bitcoin) and free markets are essential for a healthy economy that is self-healing (comes back to equilibrium).  Fiat (paper) money always leads to over printing, banksâ€™ fractional reserves decreasing, inflation, booms and busts.  History has proven this is true from the time of the American Colonies up to WWII.
* Gresham's Law: "bad money drives out good money".  This is proven thru history and human behavior.  In a bimetallic standard of gold and silver, if the ratio is fixed by law (not free market), and the silver is diluted from the circulating supply, people will hold gold and spend silver (You will hold bitcoin but spend USD or dogecoin first because bitcoin is more valuable).
* The American Colonies leading currency was the Spanish Silver Dollar, although gold, tobacco, and English coins were also in circulation.  In fact, there were many different gold and silver coins in circulation, much like cryptocurrency altcoins are today.  However, each town Bank started to issue fiat paper money to pay for things it did not have.
* The Birth of the Paper Dollar: Alexander Hamilton movement established the First Bank of the United States in 1790s.  "The United States promptly fulfilled its inflationary potential by issuing million of dollars in paper money...pyramiding on top of $2 million in specie. [pg. 68-69]."
    >   * "The establishment of the Bank of the United States precipitated a grave constitutional argument, the **Jeffersonians** arguing that the Constitution gave the federal government **no power** to establish a bank."
    >   * This is generally how it always starts and is a recurring theme: "Massachustts was accustomed to launching plunder expeditions against the prosperous French colony in Quebec.  Generally, the expeditions were successful, and would return to Boston, sell their booty, and pay off the soldiers with the proceeds.  This time, however, the expedition was beaten back decisively, and the soldiers returned to Boston in ill humor, grumbling for their pay.  Discontented solider are ripe for **mutiny**, so the Massachusetts government looked around in concern for a way to pay the soldiers.  It tried to borrow 3,000-4,000 pounds from Boston merchants, but evidently the Massachusetts credit rating was not the best.  Finally, Massachusetts decided in December 1690 to print 7,000 lbs in paper notes and to use them to pay the soldiers.  Suspecting that the public would not accept the irredeemable paper, the government made a twofold pledge when it issued the notes: that it would redeem them in gold or silver out of tax revenue in a few years and that absolutely no further paper notes would be issued.  Characteristically, however, both parts of the pledge went quickly by the board.  The issue limit disappeared in a few months, and all the bills continued unredeemed for nearly 40 years.  As early as February 1691, the Massachusetts government proclaimed that its issue had fallen "far short" and so it proceeded to emit 40,000 pounds of new money to repay all of its outstanding debt, again pledging falsely that this would be the absolute final note issue. [Pg 54-55]" Right...
* Andrew Jackson and the Bank Wars 1819: The Jacksonians were largely misunderstood from history, they were Libertarians, plain and simple.  The pioneered Currency School analysis of boom-bust cycles on fiat paper printing and bank credit expansion/deflation.  They favored minimal government, and the separation of government from the banking system and a shift from inflactionary paper money and fractional reserve banking to pure specie and banks confined to 100 percent reserves [pg. 90-91].  Their movement of hard money, small government, private property, free markets, led to a period of economic prosperity and stability up until the Civil War (1860s), although there were bumps in the road.
* Civil War & Greenbacks, example of printing money and issuing debt to pay for war.  The Civil war ended the separation of the federal government from banking, and brought the two institutions together in an increasingly close and permanent symbiosis [pg.122].
    >   * "The Civil War led to an enormous ballooning of federal expenditures, which skyrocketed from $66 million in 1861 to $1.30 billion four years later [pg. 123]."
    >   * "The U.S. government quickly took advantage of being on an inconvertible fiat standard.  In the **Legal Tender Act of February 1862**, Congress authorized the printing of $150 million in new "United States notes" (soon to be known as "greenbacks") to pay for the growing war deficits [pg. 123]"
    >   * "Greenbacks began to depreciate in terms of specie almost as soon as they were issued...[the Treasury and government] conveniently placed blame on anonymous "gold speculators" [instead of acknowledging the root cause] [pg. 124]."
* Federal Reserve Founding, up to 1913: Led by J.P. Morgan and Company, a highly coordinated political and social manipulation to orchestrate a "mid west grass roots movement" against monopolies, to gain public opinion, ultimately for a central banking monopoly to use the powers of the government to establish and maintain cartels by **coercion** [pg. 184].
    >   * "The financial elites of this country, notable the Morgan, Rockefeller, and Kuhn, Loeb interests, were responsible for putting through the Federal Reserve System, as a governmentally created and sanctioned cartel device to enable the nation's banks to inflate the money supply in a coordinated fashion, without suffering quick retribution from depositors or noteholders demanding cash.  Recent researchers, however, have also highlighted the vital supporting role of the growing number of technocratic experts and academics, who were happy to lend the patina of their allegedly scientific expertise to the elites' drive for a central bank. [pg.258-259]."
